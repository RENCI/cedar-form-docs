The Data Availability form section has ten fields ( click below to expand guidance for each field ): Will the study collect or produce data? Yes/No How to answer Not all HEAL studies will collect or produce data. For example, some studies will do the \u2018pre-work\u2019 of developing methods and protocols for later use by future studies that will implement and collect data using that developed protocol. If your study will NOT collect or produce data , but will produce shareable products other than data (e.g. protocols, slide decks, etc.) please answer \u201cNo\u201d to this question and \u201cYes\u201d to a later question in this section that asks if your study will produce shareable products other than data.

How this field will be used This field will allow Platform users that are specifically looking for study data that may be useful for their purposes AND very easy to quickly access (e.g. because they want to execute a project quickly, perhaps prior to a newspaper article or proposal deadline) to filter down to studies that will share some or all of the data they collect or produce as open access/minimal access controls. This field may also be used by the Platform to flag studies for outreach to HEAL investigators based on their answers to provide data sharing support and extend data collaboration invitations. Has data collection/production started? Not started/Started/Finished How to answer This field ONLY APPLIES if you answered \u201cYes\u201d to \u201cWill the study collect or produce data?\u201d If your study has not started collecting data at all, select \u201cNot started\u201d. If your study has multiple parts/aims, select this option if NO part/aim of your study has started collecting data. If your study has started collecting data but is not finished, select \u201cStarted\u201d. If your study has multiple parts/aims, select this option if any part/aim of your study has started collecting data. If your study has finished collecting data, select \u201cFinished\u201d. If your study has multiple parts/aims, select this option if ALL parts/aims of your study have finished collecting data. This field will need to be updated as a HEAL study moves through its life-cycle - see here for information on how to update. How this field will be used This field will allow Platform users that are specifically looking for study data that may be useful for their purposes to filter down to studies that are at different stages of data collection. Filtering to studies that are at later stages of data collection (e.g. \u201cStarted\u201d or \u201cFinished\u201d) will allow Platform users to find studies that are closer to having data available for request by Platform users. This field will also allow Platform users that may not be interested in obtaining study data, but are interested solely in the findings/results of the study, to filter down to studies where it\u2019s likely that a study publication with findings/results can be expected soon. This field may also be used by the Platform to flag studies for outreach to HEAL investigators based on their answers to provide data sharing support and extend data collaboration invitations AND by the NIH HEAL office to track HEAL data collection progress.

Will the study produce shareable products other than data? Yes/No How to answer Regardless of whether your study will or will not collect or produce data , if your study will produce shareable products other than data (e.g. protocols, slide decks, data dictionaries etc.) please answer \u201cYes\u201d to this question. How this field will be used While the majority of HEAL studies produce data, and are required to share that data in some format, there are some studies that do the 'pre-work' for studies relevant to HEAL (e.g. protocol development) that do not collect data, and there are some studies (i.e. small business grant studies) that are not obligated to share data. This field will allow Platform users that are specifically 1) looking for non-data materials such as protocols developed by 'pre-work' HEAL-funded studies, and/or 2) interested in learning as much about studies that will not share data (sucy as small business grant studies) as possible, perhaps to explore the possibility of contacting the study leads to develop a collaborative relationship.

Some studies or data collection efforts may be more focused on understanding the access or availability of treatments, interventions, or solution (e.g. SAMHSA N-SSATS and N-MHSS datasets) Just as many/the majority of HEAL studies can be thought of as either condition- or treatment-focused, we expect that folks from a wide variety of roles coming to the HEAL Platform (HEAL Platform users) will also generally be looking for studies, study data, and study-generated knowledge in a condition- or treatment-focused manner; they will want to find studies, study data, and study-generated knowledge that allow them to better study and/or understand 1) a human opoid or pain condition and/or 2) treatments, interventions, or solutions at the individual or community level that address human opioid or pain conditions. We expect that metadata entered in this section (including identification of your study as either Condition- or Treatment-focused) will allow Platform users to quickly filter down to the broad type of study, study data, or study-generated knowledge in which they are most interested In the case that your HEAL study does not fit the case of being either Condition- or Treatment-focused (e.g. some HEAL funded work will focus on career development, increasing diversity, developing general study recruitment or consenting procedures, etc.), please skip the fields in this form section. Please feel free to reach out to us at heal-support@datacommons.io if you are unsure or could use some guidance - we are happy to help! The Study Translational Focus form section has two fields ( click below to expand guidance for each field ): Study Translational Focus How to answer This field allows selection of a single answer from a limited set of possible answers. Possible answers are \"Condition\" for Condition-focused studies, and \"Treatment\" for Treatment-focused studies. See above for definitions of these different types of studies. In the case of human subjects studies , a Condition-focused study might look like an observational prospective cohort study following developmental markers in babies exposed to opioids in utero from birth through adolesence; a Treatment-focused study might look like a randomized control trial testing efficacy of a novel non-opioid drug for pain versus status quo use of an opioid drug. In the case of basic science or non-human subjects studies , a Condition-focused study might look like a biochemical study investigating the molecular mechanisms of cell signalling in pain/nociception; a Treatment-focused study might look a small molecule screen to discover chemical drugs that activate or deactivate a molecular target involved in opioid-addictive or overdose pathways. How this field will be used The values from this field will likely be available as an \"Advanced Search\" filter on the HEAL Platform Discovery page. As noted above, we expect that folks from a wide variety of roles coming to the HEAL Platform (HEAL Platform users) will often be looking for studies, study data, and study-generated knowledge in a condition- or treatment-focused manner; They will want to find studies, study data, and study-generated knowledge that allow them to better study and/or understand 1) a human opoid or pain condition and/or 2) treatments, interventions, or solutions at the individual or community level that address human opioid or pain conditions. We expect that identification of your study as either Condition- or Treatment-focused will allow Platform users to quickly filter down to the broad type of study, study data, or study-generated knowledge in which they are most interested Types of Determinants/Mechanisms the study is investigating How to answer This field allows selection of multiple answers from a limited set of possible answers. Please choose all that apply.Possible answers are \"Biology and Health\", \"Mental Health\", \"Social Determinants\", and \"Public Attitudes or Stigma\". If your study is Condition-focused , think about what types of determinants or mechanisms of the human opioid or pain condition you are investigating: a study focused on molecular or biophysical mechanism of bodily injury and pain perception would select \"Biology and Health\" an observational study measuring the incidence and timing of onset of rumination and other anxiety or depressive symptoms/states in patients that do or do not transition from acute to chronic pain would select \"Mental Health\" if the same study also measures items such as income and education level, family support, access to healthcare and food, etc. then they would ALSO select \"Social Determinants\" if the same study also measures items such as the individual's perceived level of stigma from friends/family/employers around their pain experience they they would also select \"Public Attitudes or Stigma\" a survey study of a random sample of Americans asking these individuals about their own attitudes towards individuals with opioid use disorder would select \"Public Attitudes or Stigma\"; they may also select \"Social Determinants\" (since public attitudes and stigma are a subset of all social determinants) If your study is Treatment-focused , think about the mechanism of the treatment, intervention or solution you are investigating: a small molecule screen study looking for drugs that inhibit a novel protein target in the opioid reward pathway as a possible drug candidate to treat opioid use disorder, or a study investigating efficacy of a drug or surgical procedure to treat chronic back pain, would select \"Biology and Health\" a study investigating relative efficacy of group therapy versus one-on-one therapy to prevent opioid use relapse would select \"Mental Health\" a study investigating efficacy of providing individuals with a history of opioid use who are leaving jail with either medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) alone or MOUD plus supports such as housing, food, and education/employment assistance would select \"Biology and Health\" AND \"Social Determinants\" a study investigating efficacy of a community-level communications campaign focused on a central message of opioid use disorder as a disease of health condition to change publica attitudes/reduce stigma towards individuals with opioid use disorder would select \"Public Attitudes or Stigma\" How this field will be used The values from this field will likely be available as an \"Advanced Search\" filter on the HEAL Platform Discovery page. Platform users looking for information about treatments for a human opioid use or pain condition may specifically be interested in a certain type of treatment mode and can use this field to filter down to the studies in which they are most interested; A patient with opioid use disorder may want to specifically look for something like a mental health intervention/treatment because they are reluctant to use medication to treat their condition, or they are in a rehab facility that does not allow medication (filter on value \"Mental Health\"); A pain clinician who has historically treated patients with opioid drugs and seen some patients become addicted may specifically want to look for information on any non-opioid drugs for treating pain (filter on value \"Biology and Health\"); A public health official in an area with high rates of opioid overdose despite high naloxone availability might suspect that social determinants (e.g. attitudes/stigma, lack of communication/education, lack of transportation to distribution centers, etc.) are playing a role in low uptake/effective use of naloxone to prevent overdoses (filter on value \"Social Determinants\").

Focused on individual or community level treatments for human opioid or pain conditions; many HEAL studies will be investigating the potential for treatments, interventions, or solutions at some stage \u2013 very early/discovery stage of either targets or mechanisms to impact those targets, efficacy of a mechanism to impact a target, implementation. Some studies or data collection efforts may be more focused on understanding the access or availability of treatments, interventions, or solution (e.g. SAMHSA N-SSATS and N-MHSS datasets) Just as many/the majority of HEAL studies can be thought of as either condition- or treatment-focused, we expect that folks from a wide variety of roles coming to the HEAL Platform (HEAL Platform users) will also generally be looking for studies, study data, and study-generated knowledge in a condition- or treatment-focused manner; they will want to find studies, study data, and study-generated knowledge that allow them to better study and/or understand 1) a human opoid or pain condition and/or 2) treatments, interventions, or solutions at the individual or community level that address human opioid or pain conditions. We expect that metadata entered in this section (including identification of your study as either Condition- or Treatment-focused) will allow Platform users to quickly filter down to the broad type of study, study data, or study-generated knowledge in which they are most interested In the case that your HEAL study does not fit the case of being either Condition- or Treatment-focused (e.g. some HEAL funded work will focus on career development, increasing diversity, developing general study recruitment or consenting procedures, etc.), please skip the fields in this form section. Please feel free to reach out to us at heal-support@datacommons.io if you are unsure or could use some guidance - we are happy to help! The Study Translational Focus form section has two fields ( click below to expand guidance for each field ): Study Translational Focus How to answer This field allows selection of a single answer from a limited set of possible answers. Possible answers are \"Condition\" for Condition-focused studies, and \"Treatment\" for Treatment-focused studies. See above for definitions of these different types of studies. In the case of human subjects studies , a Condition-focused study might look like an observational prospective cohort study following developmental markers in babies exposed to opioids in utero from birth through adolesence; a Treatment-focused study might look like a randomized control trial testing efficacy of a novel non-opioid drug for pain versus status quo use of an opioid drug. In the case of basic science or non-human subjects studies , a Condition-focused study might look like a biochemical study investigating the molecular mechanisms of cell signalling in pain/nociception; a Treatment-focused study might look a small molecule screen to discover chemical drugs that activate or deactivate a molecular target involved in opioid-addictive or overdose pathways. How this field will be used The values from this field will likely be available as an \"Advanced Search\" filter on the HEAL Platform Discovery page. As noted above, we expect that folks from a wide variety of roles coming to the HEAL Platform (HEAL Platform users) will often be looking for studies, study data, and study-generated knowledge in a condition- or treatment-focused manner; They will want to find studies, study data, and study-generated knowledge that allow them to better study and/or understand 1) a human opoid or pain condition and/or 2) treatments, interventions, or solutions at the individual or community level that address human opioid or pain conditions. We expect that identification of your study as either Condition- or Treatment-focused will allow Platform users to quickly filter down to the broad type of study, study data, or study-generated knowledge in which they are most interested Types of Determinants/Mechanisms the study is investigating How to answer This field allows selection of multiple answers from a limited set of possible answers. Please choose all that apply.Possible answers are \"Biology and Health\", \"Mental Health\", \"Social Determinants\", and \"Public Attitudes or Stigma\". If your study is Condition-focused , think about what types of determinants or mechanisms of the human opioid or pain condition you are investigating: a study focused on molecular or biophysical mechanism of bodily injury and pain perception would select \"Biology and Health\" an observational study measuring the incidence and timing of onset of rumination and other anxiety or depressive symptoms/states in patients that do or do not transition from acute to chronic pain would select \"Mental Health\" if the same study also measures items such as income and education level, family support, access to healthcare and food, etc. then they would ALSO select \"Social Determinants\" if the same study also measures items such as the individual's perceived level of stigma from friends/family/employers around their pain experience they they would also select \"Public Attitudes or Stigma\" a survey study of a random sample of Americans asking these individuals about their own attitudes towards individuals with opioid use disorder would select \"Public Attitudes or Stigma\"; they may also select \"Social Determinants\" (since public attitudes and stigma are a subset of all social determinants) If your study is Treatment-focused , think about the mechanism of the treatment, intervention or solution you are investigating: a small molecule screen study looking for drugs that inhibit a novel protein target in the opioid reward pathway as a possible drug candidate to treat opioid use disorder, or a study investigating efficacy of a drug or surgical procedure to treat chronic back pain, would select \"Biology and Health\" a study investigating relative efficacy of group therapy versus one-on-one therapy to prevent opioid use relapse would select \"Mental Health\" a study investigating efficacy of providing individuals with a history of opioid use who are leaving jail with either medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) alone or MOUD plus supports such as housing, food, and education/employment assistance would select \"Biology and Health\" AND \"Social Determinants\" a study investigating efficacy of a community-level communications campaign focused on a central message of opioid use disorder as a disease of health condition to change publica attitudes/reduce stigma towards individuals with opioid use disorder would select \"Public Attitudes or Stigma\" How this field will be used The values from this field will likely be available as an \"Advanced Search\" filter on the HEAL Platform Discovery page. Platform users looking for information about treatments for a human opioid use or pain condition may specifically be interested in a certain type of treatment mode and can use this field to filter down to the studies in which they are most interested; A patient with opioid use disorder may want to specifically look for something like a mental health intervention/treatment because they are reluctant to use medication to treat their condition, or they are in a rehab facility that does not allow medication (filter on value \"Mental Health\"); A pain clinician who has historically treated patients with opioid drugs and seen some patients become addicted may specifically want to look for information on any non-opioid drugs for treating pain (filter on value \"Biology and Health\"); A public health official in an area with high rates of opioid overdose despite high naloxone availability might suspect that social determinants (e.g. attitudes/stigma, lack of communication/education, lack of transportation to distribution centers, etc.) are playing a role in low uptake/effective use of naloxone to prevent overdoses (filter on value \"Social Determinants\").
