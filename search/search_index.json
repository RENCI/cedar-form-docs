The Data Availability form section has ten fields ( click below to expand guidance for each field ): Will the study collect or produce data? Yes/No How to answer Not all HEAL studies will collect or produce data. For example, some studies will do the \u2018pre-work\u2019 of developing methods and protocols for later use by future studies that will implement and collect data using that developed protocol. If your study will NOT collect or produce data , but will produce shareable products other than data (e.g. protocols, slide decks, etc.) please answer \u201cNo\u201d to this question and \u201cYes\u201d to a later question in this section that asks if your study will produce shareable products other than data.

How this field will be used This field will allow Platform users that are specifically looking for study data that may be useful for their purposes AND very easy to quickly access (e.g. because they want to execute a project quickly, perhaps prior to a newspaper article or proposal deadline) to filter down to studies that will share some or all of the data they collect or produce as open access/minimal access controls. This field may also be used by the Platform to flag studies for outreach to HEAL investigators based on their answers to provide data sharing support and extend data collaboration invitations. Has data collection/production started? Not started/Started/Finished How to answer This field ONLY APPLIES if you answered \u201cYes\u201d to \u201cWill the study collect or produce data?\u201d If your study has not started collecting data at all, select \u201cNot started\u201d. If your study has multiple parts/aims, select this option if NO part/aim of your study has started collecting data. If your study has started collecting data but is not finished, select \u201cStarted\u201d. If your study has multiple parts/aims, select this option if any part/aim of your study has started collecting data. If your study has finished collecting data, select \u201cFinished\u201d. If your study has multiple parts/aims, select this option if ALL parts/aims of your study have finished collecting data. This field will need to be updated as a HEAL study moves through its life-cycle - see here for information on how to update. How this field will be used This field will allow Platform users that are specifically looking for study data that may be useful for their purposes to filter down to studies that are at different stages of data collection. Filtering to studies that are at later stages of data collection (e.g. \u201cStarted\u201d or \u201cFinished\u201d) will allow Platform users to find studies that are closer to having data available for request by Platform users. This field will also allow Platform users that may not be interested in obtaining study data, but are interested solely in the findings/results of the study, to filter down to studies where it\u2019s likely that a study publication with findings/results can be expected soon. This field may also be used by the Platform to flag studies for outreach to HEAL investigators based on their answers to provide data sharing support and extend data collaboration invitations AND by the NIH HEAL office to track HEAL data collection progress.

Will the study produce shareable products other than data? Yes/No How to answer Regardless of whether your study will or will not collect or produce data , if your study will produce shareable products other than data (e.g. protocols, slide decks, data dictionaries etc.) please answer \u201cYes\u201d to this question. How this field will be used While the majority of HEAL studies produce data, and are required to share that data in some format, there are some studies that do the 'pre-work' for studies relevant to HEAL (e.g. protocol development) that do not collect data, and there are some studies (i.e. small business grant studies) that are not obligated to share data. This field will allow Platform users that are specifically 1) looking for non-data materials such as protocols developed by 'pre-work' HEAL-funded studies, and/or 2) interested in learning as much about studies that will not share data (sucy as small business grant studies) as possible, perhaps to explore the possibility of contacting the study leads to develop a collaborative relationship.

Please consider: For the majority of HEAL researcher whether conducting a basic science study, clinical trial, implementation or epidemiologic study, the study will pertain somehow to understanding more about a human pain or opioid related condition and/or treatments, interventions, or solutions addressing a human pain or opioid related condition . Which human pain or opioid related condition(s) does your study contribute to understanding? Examples include: e.g. If I am doing a pragmatic clinical trial to treat fibromyalgia pain with a combination of physical therapy and electrophysiotherapy, I would likely select \"Pain\", \"Pain, chronic\", and \"Pain, resulting from chronic illness\" here; If I am doing a basic biochemistry study to understand the mechanism of binding of fentanyl to opioid receptors in the brain and signaling systems triggered as a result of this binding, I might choose \"Opioid overdose\" and/or \"Opioid use and opioid use disorder\" How this field will be used The values from this field will likely be available as an \"Advanced Search\" filter on the HEAL Platform Discovery page, and will allow Platform users to quickly filter down to the broad type of study, study data, or study-generated knowledge in which they are most interested. Examples include: I'm a pre-K/K school teacher and I know that the community around my school has high rates of OUD - I wonder if some of the behavioral issues my students have can be attributed to affects of in utero exposure to opioids and if so, how I can recognize these exposure impacts and potentially provide support and intervention to my students and their parents (filter on \"Opioid exposure\" ) I'm a family member of or case manager for a person taking medication for chronic OUD who is also at high risk of relapse and I want to identify appropriate OUD treatment(s), and learn about geographic and other factors that may impact my family member or client's ability to access these treatments (filter on \"Opioid use and opioid use disorder, relapse\" , \"Opioid use and opioid use disorder, chronic\" ) I'm a clinician treating OUD patients and I notice that there's a high rate of relapse among my patients - I want to see if there's any research on risk factors for relapse, or on preventive or therapeutic interventions that specifically target relapse of OUD (filter on \"Opioid use and opioid use disorder, relapse\" ) I'm a patient scheduled for surgery, and my doctor has told me I'll need to take opioids for acute post-surgical pain - I don't want to take opioids because I'm worried about becoming addicted to opioids, or in the case of someone with a history of OUD, triggering a relapse and I want to see if there's any research on non-drug, or non-opioid drug treatments to address acute post-surgical pain (filter on \"Pain, acute\" , \"Pain, resulting from surgery\" ) Opioid use and/or Pain condition - Investigation Stage or Type How to answer This field allows selection of multiple answers from a limited set of possible answers.

When you first click into this field, you may see some \"odd\" looking values that belong to a category of the NLM MeSH that does not apply well to this field. If you start typing in the health condition you are looking for (e.g. start typing in the first letters of the health condition \"fibromyalgia\"), the drop down list will populate with items that start with the typed in letters and you should be able to find your condition of interest. Please consider: If your study is studying a human pain condition or a treatment, intervention, or solution for a human pain condition, is there a source/causal condition(s) for the pain condition your study is focusing on? If yes, please indicate the causal condition(s) here. E.g. A study investigating mechanism of or risk for disabling chronic pain in fibromyalgia patients would select the condition \"fibromyalgia\"; A study measuring incidence and intensity of pain following back surgery would select \"surgery\" and/or \"failed back surgery syndrome\". NLM MeSH allows you to be quite general (e.g. \"chronic disease\", \"multiple chronic conditions\") and/or quite specific (e.g. \"end stage liver disease\", \"osteoarthritis, knee\").
