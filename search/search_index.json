If you need to update metadata fields from the CEDAR form before this portal is available, please reach out to the Platform Help Desk at heal-support@datacommons.io for assistance. The Data Availability form section has ten fields ( click below to expand guidance for each field ): Will the study collect or produce data? Yes/No How to answer: Not all HEAL studies will collect or produce data. For example, some studies will do the \u2018pre-work\u2019 of developing methods and protocols for later use by future studies that will implement and collect data using that developed protocol. If your study will NOT collect or produce data , but will produce shareable products other than data (e.g. protocols, slide decks, etc.) please answer \u201cNo\u201d to this question and \u201cYes\u201d to a later question in this section that asks if your study will produce shareable products other than data. How this field will be used: This field will allow Platform users that are specifically looking for study data that may be useful for their purposes to filter down to studies that will collect or produce data, and filter out those studies that will not collect or produce data. This field may also be used by the Platform to flag studies for outreach to HEAL investigators based on their answers to provide data sharing support and extend data collaboration invitations.

If your study plans to make all data available to the greatest extent possible (e.g. sharing very close to raw clinical trial data in a data repository with strong access control mechanisms and subject to very strong access controls, including some features data that may be very useful for specific analysis but also pose a real risk of re-identification, such as highly granular geographic information, detailed diagnostic and care provision or utilization patterns, and/or clinician notes), select \u201cAll\u201d. How this field will be used: This field will allow Platform users that are specifically looking for study data that may be useful for their purposes to filter down to studies that will share some or all of the data they collect or produce, and filter out those studies that will not share data. Some users, especially those who may be interested specifically in data features that represent substantial risk of re-identification in a dataset (e.g. high geographic granularity), may specifically want to filter down to studies that plan to share \u201cAll\u201d data in order to filter out studies that will only share extensively de-identified data.

If your study plans for some of the data that it makes available in a data repository to be open access or very minimally restricted (i.e. available following signing of a minimal DUA that does not require any manual intervention or approval), while some of the data that it makes available will be available only following a request and approval process that does require substantial manual intervention (e.g. submission of a project proposal and IRB approval by the requestor; review by a Data Access Committee on the repository end; etc.), then select \u201cSome\u201d. An example of a study that may choose this option is a clinical trial that will share both 1) an extensively de-identified dataset that is open access/minimal access controls, AND 2) a less de-identified dataset that includes features that add value for many analysis questions, but also present substantial risk for re-identification, that is shared via the repository under strict access controls. If your study plans for all of the data that it makes available in a data repository to be available only following a request and approval process that does require substantial manual intervention (e.g. submission of a project proposal and IRB approval by the requestor; review by a Data Access Committee on the repository end; etc.), then select \u201cAll\u201d.

This field will need to be updated as a HEAL study moves through its life-cycle - see here for information on how to update. How this field will be used: This field will allow Platform users that are specifically looking for study data that may be useful for their purposes to filter down to studies that are at different stages of data collection. Filtering to studies that are at later stages of data collection (e.g. \u201cStarted\u201d or \u201cFinished\u201d) will allow Platform users to find studies that are closer to having data available for request by Platform users. This field will also allow Platform users that may not be interested in obtaining study data, but are interested solely in the findings/results of the study, to filter down to studies where it\u2019s likely that a study publication with findings/results can be expected soon.

Yes/No How to answer: Regardless of whether your study will or will not collect or produce data , if your study will produce shareable products other than data (e.g. protocols, slide decks, data dictionaries etc.) please answer \u201cYes\u201d to this question. How this field will be used: While the majority of HEAL studies produce data, and are required to share that data in some format, there are some studies that do the 'pre-work' for studies relevant to HEAL (e.g. protocol development) that do not collect data, and there are some studies (i.e. small business grant studies) that are not obligated to share data. This field will allow Platform users that are specifically 1) looking for non-data materials such as protocols developed by 'pre-work' HEAL-funded studies, and/or 2) interested in learning as much about studies that will not share data (sucy as small business grant studies) as possible, perhaps to explore the possibility of contacting the study leads to develop a collaborative relationship.

If your study has multiple parts/aims, select this option if any part/aim of your study has started collecting data. If your study has finished collecting data, select \u201cFinished\u201d. If your study has multiple parts/aims, select this option if ALL parts/aims of your study have finished collecting data. This field will need to be updated as a HEAL study moves through its life-cycle - see here for information on how to update. How this field will be used: This field will allow Platform users that are specifically looking for study data that may be useful for their purposes to filter down to studies that are at different stages of data collection. Filtering to studies that are at later stages of data collection (e.g. \u201cStarted\u201d or \u201cFinished\u201d) will allow Platform users to find studies that are closer to having data available for request by Platform users. This field will also allow Platform users that may not be interested in obtaining study data, but are interested solely in the findings/results of the study, to filter down to studies where it\u2019s likely that a study publication with findings/results can be expected soon. This field may also be used by the Platform to flag studies for outreach to HEAL investigators based on their answers to provide data sharing support and extend data collaboration invitations AND by the NIH HEAL office to track HEAL data collection progress. Has data release started?

Will the study produce shareable products other than data? Yes/No How to answer: Regardless of whether your study will or will not collect or produce data , if your study will produce shareable products other than data (e.g. protocols, slide decks, data dictionaries etc.) please answer \u201cYes\u201d to this question. How this field will be used: While the majority of HEAL studies produce data, and are required to share that data in some format, there are some studies that do the 'pre-work' for studies relevant to HEAL (e.g. protocol development) that do not collect data, and there are some studies (i.e. small business grant studies) that are not obligated to share data. This field will allow Platform users that are specifically 1) looking for non-data materials such as protocols developed by 'pre-work' HEAL-funded studies, and/or 2) interested in learning as much about studies that will not share data (sucy as small business grant studies) as possible, perhaps to explore the possibility of contacting the study leads to develop a collaborative relationship. This field may also be used by the Platform to flag studies for outreach to HEAL investigators based on their answers to provide support for sharing non-data study products.
