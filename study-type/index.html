<p>The Study Type form section has five fields (<mark>click below to expand guidance for each field</mark>):</p>
<p><details><summary><strong>Category or Type/Stage of Study Research</strong></summary><blockquote></p>
<p><details><summary><strong>How to answer</strong></summary><blockquote>
    This field allows selection of multiple answers from a limited set of possible answers. Please choose all that apply.Possible answers are "Pre-Research/Protocol Development", "Basic Research", "Pre-Clinical Research", "Clinical Research", "Implementation Research", "Post-market Research", "Business Development", "Epidemiologic Research". If none of these answers apply, please skip the question, or reach out to heal-support@datacommons.io for questions or support - we are happy to help!
</blockquote></details>
<details><summary><strong>How this field will be used</strong></summary><blockquote>
    The values from this field will likely be available as an "Advanced Search" filter on the HEAL Platform Discovery page, and will allow Platform users to quickly filter down to the broad type of study, study data, or study-generated knowledge in which they are most interested. <strong>Examples include:</strong> A pain patient may be specifically interested in looking for novel treatments that are already at the clinical trial stage (filter on "Clinical Research"); An OUD patient on medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) who thinks the drug may be causing some unexpected side-effects for them may specifically be looking for any studies that have information on efficacy and side effects of this drug "in the real world" (filter on "Post-market Research"); A clinician or health system may be interested in finding information on how best to implement a promising new treatment or clinical process for pain patients in their practice (filter on "Implementation Research").

<p><details><summary><strong>Is the study conducting primary or secondary research?</strong></summary><blockquote></p>
<p><details><summary><strong>How to answer</strong></summary><blockquote> 
    This field allows selection of a single answer from a limited set of possible answers. Possible answers are "Primary Research" or "Secondary Research". If your study will collect primary data (i.e. will take measurements of any kind to generate data that will be used to address the study research question) OR your study will conduct an active experiment please select "Primary Research". If your study will NOT collect primary data AND your study will NOT conduct an active experiment please select "Secondary Research". If none of these answers apply, please skip the question, or reach out to heal-support@datacommons.io for questions or support - we are happy to help!  <br />

<p><details><summary><strong>How to answer</strong></summary><blockquote>
    This field allows selection of a single answer from a limited set of possible answers. Possible answers are "Observational Research" or "Experimental Research". If your study will NOT conduct an active experiment (e.g. may consist of actively or passively collecting measurements without any intervention, or in the context of a naturally occurring intervention - a "natural experiment") please select "Observational Research".If your study will conduct an active experiment please select "Experimental Research".

<p><details><summary><strong>How to answer</strong></summary><blockquote> 
    This field allows selection of multiple answers from a limited set of possible answers. Please choose all that apply.Possible answers are "Human", "Animal", "Human cell/tissue/tissue model", "Animal cell/tissue/tissue model", "Molecule". Select "Human" if you will be treating or observing human subjects in your study (individuals or communities of human subjects; e.g. for example, your study is a clinical trial, a cross sectional survey, a prospective cohort study, a clinical process implementation trial, a community-based cluster randomized control trial, etc.); Select "Animal" if you will be treating or observing animals/animal models in your study (e.g. mice, zebrafish, drosophila); Select "Human cell/tissue/tissue model" or "Animal cell/tissue/tissue model" if you will be treating or observing human or animal cells in your study, respectively (primary or cultured); Select "Molecule" if you will be treating or observing molecules of some variety in your study (e.g. enzymology study, chemical/protein binding or engineering study, protein crystallization, etc.). <u>If your study is computational in nature</u>, please consider your computational subject of interest when answering this question (e.g. if modeling humans or human interaction, select "Human"; if modeling molecules/molecular interactions, select "Molecule").
